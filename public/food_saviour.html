                  <h2>Introduction</h2>
                  <p class="introductionTxt">
                      Food Saviour is a 3 person prototyping project. 
                      It is for on of our academic module that focuses on creating user interfaces that fits the user requirements and is easy to navigate and use. 
                      As we all know, if we create complex interfaces that users cannot navigate or contains broken navigation, the user simply cannot use it. 
                      Therefore, Food Saviour is a project that aims to provide users with an easy to use interface as well as serves the purpose of the application that fits the user needs. 
                      <br><br>
                      The prototype for Food Savior is created using marvelapp. 
                      Food Savior initially started as a mobile app prototype as we will be required to deal with the small screen that mobile devices provides to fully utilize the space in it. 
                      The final prototype changes the application to be tablet based to cater for more features, functions and as well as efficient usage of the spaces that tablet provides.
                  </p>
              </div>

              <h2>Features</h2>
              <h4>Login</h4>
              <div class="section-inline">
                <div class="img-left all-img-config img1-config">
                  <img class="all-image" src="./assets/Food_Saviour/Login Page.png">
                </div>
                <p class="text-right">
                  Just like all applications, Food Savior also has a Login page as a landing page right after the splash screen (Refer to image above). 
                  The user input their email and password to enter the application. 
                  <br><br>
                  For our prototype we only focus on food donater and food deliveryman. 
                  The interface for admins and food donation receiver will operate in a totally separate application which is not yet developed. 
                  <br><br>
                  The register button also lies in the Login Page. 
                  It will help facilitate food donation donor and deliveryman to register an account. 
                </p>
              </div>
        <div class="margin"></div>
        <h4>Delivery Page</h4>
        <div class="section-inline">
          <p class="text-left">
            One of the highlighted features was the food delivery feature. 
            It allows the user to choose which were the food delivery service required nearby. 
            Volunteers can then help to deliver the food to the receivers doorstep. 
            <br><br>
            The delivery page shows the location to deliver to as well as a list of food to be deliver.
          </p>
          <div class="img-right all-img-config img2-config">
            <img class="all-image" src="./assets/Food_Saviour/Delivery Page.png">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="margin"></div>
        <h4>To-Buy List</h4>
        <div class="section-inline">
          <div class="img-left all-img-config img3-config">
            <img class="all-image" src="./assets/Food_Saviour/To-Buy List Page.png">
          </div>
          <p class="text-right">
            We also included a feature for the users who wish to donate food to be able to directly use the app for their to-buy list. 
            For the sake of convenience, the user can also input the food expiry date for them to keep a record of the expiry date for the food they buy. 
          </p>
        </div>
  <div class="margin"></div>
  <h4>Chats Page</h4>
        <div class="section-inline">
          <p class="text-left">
            In order to handle the event of the deliveryman was unable to locate the unit to deliver to or any unwanted circumstances, the chats feature came in to overcome the issue. 
            It allows the users to chat through it for important informations to pass through or any last minute cancellations. 
          </p>
          <div class="img-right all-img-config img4-config">
            <img class="all-image" src="./assets/Food_Saviour/Chats Page.png">
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="margin"></div>
        <h4>Account Page</h4>
        <div class="section-inline">
          <div class="img-left all-img-config img5-config">
            <img class="all-image" src="./assets/Food_Saviour/Account Page.png">
          </div>
          <p class="text-right">
           Last but not least the account page which allows the user to edit their account details and choose their prefered colour theme. 
           This page also display the rating of the user by the food recipients and donation drives. 
            <br><br>
            That basically wraps up all the main features of the prototype.
