                <br>I ‘m Eric Ng Yong Wei, just call me Eric.
                <br><br><br>I started programming since I’ve entered Diploma in Information Technology course of Singapore Polytechnic when I was 18. I have been always wanted to be a game programmer. As such I am working my way towards university to get a Degree in Computer Science to build awesome games on all platforms.
                <br><br><br>As time passes, I start to get attached to developing the back end server application, and thus, I strive to create stable, consistent and efficient server applications that requires minimum effort to both the server app and the database to communicate.
                <br><br><br>Despite that I have less experience, I am always ready to pick-up the role of a team leader when it comes to school projects. Even though I’ve been assigned as a normal team member, I will always give it all I can to contribute as a team member to solve technical issues, providing ideas, giving critiques on different design and coding style so does it for resolving team conflicts
                <br><br><br>Depending on the composition of the team, I am usually working on the back-end application and database design to hone my skills on the field I am most interested. However if needed, I am always ready to wear the hat as a UI & UX designer and Front end developer.
                <br><br><br>I am also always looking forward to challenges in programming and have been through trying programming algorithms from HackerRank and as well as managed to solve the Weighted Activity Selection Problem before in school project
                <br><br><br>Have an idea in mind or interesting project sourcing for teammates? <a class="special" href="#footer">Contact me!</a>
