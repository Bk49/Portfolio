            <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
              <p class="introductionTxt">Shopmania was a pair programming work between me and one of my best teammate Khye Lerk's work
                In this project, we were using MVC framework to create a dynamic web project which is a website that if used for e-commerce mainly selling computer accessories.
                It is created using JSP pages, JavaBeans and MySQL database. 
                The database is hosted on Heroku using the ClearDB to keep it running at all times.
                <br><br>
                Shopmania is also hosted on <a onclick="window.open('https://shopmaniajad.azurewebsites.net/JAD_CA2/GoProductDetail?productId=31')" class="linkTxt1">Azure</a>.
                However due to some part of the project was not uploaded by my teammate, the website will contain a few broken links.
              </p>
          
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <h4>Login and Home</h4>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <div class="img-left img1-config">
                    <img class="all-image img1" src="./assets/Shopmania/Home.png">

                  <p class="text-right">
                    Start off with the home page which serves as a landing page for all the users.
                    Public users need not to register or login to an account to start browsing for products. 
                    <br><br>
                    It contains all the product categories that the user can browse. 
                    Below of it displays 10 random products selected from all the products available in the store.
                  </p>

          <div class="margin"></div>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <p class="text-left">
                    From the home page, there will be a Login button at the top right corner where user can proceed to input their login details to login as a member or admin.
                    The user will be redirected back to home page with the user session if the user is just a normal member.
                    Admins will instead be redirected to an alternative admin page.
                    <br><br>
                    For new users, they can also register for a new account at the login page with their details.
                  </p>

                <h4>Admin Pages</h4>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <div class="img-left img3-config">

                  <p class="text-right">
                    One of the administrator power is their ability to add new products, discount codes or users.
                    Image at the left shows how the adminstrator can a new product using the website interface to input new rows into the database.
                  </p>

                <div class="margin"></div>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <p class="text-left">
                    Admins can also use the website to modify and edit products that were previously in the database already and ammend them.
                    <br><br>
                    Since every product come with their unique ID, their names can be changed to be the same as others as well and also treated as non-duplicated and separated objects.
                    This can especially help on products with same names but comes in different conditions such as colors etc. which are treated as individual products.
                  </p>
                  <div class="img-right img4-config">

                  <p class="text-right">
                    The last important administrator power is their ability to delete products, discount codes and users in the database completely.
                    <br><br>
                    Since deleted items can no longer be retrieved again, to prevent accidental lost of data, a confirmation will be done to confirm with the admin whether to remain the items or not.
                    It will display the target to be deleted to ensure it was the item to be deleted to prevent deleting of items that has similar or identical names.
                  </p>

                    This image shows an overall look of the admin view.
                    An important point to mention is regarding the security of the admin pages since it is in the same domain that can be accessed by the users.
                    <br><br>
                    Since prepared statements are used for the whole project, SQL injection is not possible. 
                    The admin pages are also safe from Broken Access Control since for all the admin pages, the user session will be checked for the role first before being displayed. 
                    If the user was a member, they will never make it to access these pages.
