            <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
              <p class="introductionTxt">DeviousComet465 (currently a temporary name) was a discord bot that I’ve created after creating 2 of similar projects hosted on glitch.me. 
                Unfortunately, due to change of policy of glitch, the project hosted there can no longer stay online and hosted 24/7 so I decided to move the project over to be used on repl.it which does not disable third party pinging applications such as Uptime Robot to ping the server every few seconds to keep the bot alive. 
                The bot  is currently still under development and contains a few very basic features.</p>
          
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <h4>Avatar</h4>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <div class="img-left img1-config">
                    <img class="all-image img1" src="./assets/Discord/avatarbot.png">
                  </div>
                  <p class="text-right">
                    By using the command !avatar bot, the user can get the bot’s details regarding its creator (which is me), the creation date as well as a quote. 
                    The quote is obtained from an API that generates random quote. 
                    All of these are achieved using discord.js library and using axios to perform a get for the quote. It is also made possible using Promise technique instead of the traditional callback technique.
                  </p>
                </div>
          <div class="margin"></div>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <p class="text-left">
                    The avatar command also  supports for user avatar. 
                    The arguments will require the user to input their discord tag as well in order to get their discord account details such as their current status, time of creations of their Discord Account as well as if they were bot.
                    <br><br>
                    Same thing goes with the quotes, it is using the same API.
                    <br><br>
                    An image of the user’s profile picture will also be displayed with a magnified size.
                  </p>
                  <div class="img-right img2-config">
                    <img class="all-image img2" src="./assets/Discord/avataruser.png">
                  </div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="margin"></div>

                <h4>Help</h4>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <div class="img-left img3-config">
                    <img class="all-image img3" src="./assets/Discord/help1.png">
                  </div>
                  <p class="text-right">
                    In order to help new users of the bot to get to know of the commands provided by the bot, a dynamic help command is also available.
                    <br><br>
                    A development is currently on its way to paginate help commands since Discord can only allow up to 2000 characters per message.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="margin"></div>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <p class="text-left">
                    Additionally, the user can  also search for a specific command that they need additional help by parsing the command name as a second argument.
                    <br><br>
                    This will show the command name, aliases (which can be used as the an alternative shorthand or name for the original command name).
                    <br><br>
                    It will also display the command usage method. 
                    More details such as if the command is limited to DMs only or does it requires arguments or optional.
                  </p>
                  <div class="img-right img4-config">
                    <img class="all-image img4" src="./assets/Discord/helpavatar.png">
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h4>Error Handling</h4>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <div class="img-left img5-config">
                    <img class="all-image img5" src="./assets/Discord/errorargs.png">
                  </div>
                  <p class="text-right">
                    Sometimes, the user might input the wrong arguments or use the command wrongly. 
                    This is when error handling comes in to notify the user’s wrong usage of command and displays the right way of using it.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="margin"></div>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <p class="text-left">
                    Error handling is also applied to commands such as play which requires the user to be in a channel and cannot be done in DMs.
                    <br><br>
                    This is to let the user know the scope of the command is only around servers.
                  </p>
                  <div class="img-right img6-config">
                    <img class="all-image img6" src="./assets/Discord/errordm.png">
                  </div>
                </div>

                <div class="margin"></div>
                <h4>Additional Features</h4>
                <div class="section-inline">
                  <div class="img-left img7-config">
                    <img class="all-image img7" src="./assets/Discord/playmusic.png">
                  </div>
                  <p class="text-right">
                    More new features such as !play are still being developed. 
                    It can currently play songs in a voice channel and leave afterwards, but the play system only supports a youtube url at the moment and cannot queue musics.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, I am working very hard to come out with a backend server that can implement a currency system as well as minigames such as blackjack. 
                    Stay tune for more!
